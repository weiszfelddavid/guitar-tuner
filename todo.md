# Pro-Guitar Tuner Roadmap (Core Stability)

- [x] **Transient Masking (Pluck Detector):**
  - [x] **Implementation:** Refine `TransientMasker` into `PluckDetector`.
    - Monitor AudioWorklet RMS volume.
    - Trigger `isAttacking` state if volume increases >15dB within 20ms.
    - During `isAttacking`: Heavily damp pitch updates (interpolate at 0.1 weight) to prevent "sharp" needle jumps.
  - [ ] **Testing:** Use `generate_test_signals.ts`.
    - Scenario: "Re-pluck" (Steady signal -> Loud Spike).
    - Verify pitch output changes slowly during the spike.
- [x] **Outlier Rejection & Stabilization:**
  - [x] **Implementation:** Create `PitchStabilizer` class.
    - maintain ring buffer (size 11).
    - `getStablePitch()`: Calculate median.
    - Remove outliers (>50 cents from median).
    - Return weighted average of remaining "clean" samples.
  - [x] **Testing Infrastructure:** Create `scripts/generate_test_signals.ts`.
    - Generate synthetic buffers: Attack (Sharp) -> Sustain (Stable) -> Noise (Jitter).
    - Verify `PitchStabilizer` smooths noise but ignores transient spikes.
- **String Locking:** Add "sticky" detection logic to prevent the UI from rapidly flipping between adjacent strings.
- **Octave Priority:** Bias the algorithm to favor the fundamental frequency to prevent "octave jumping" (e.g., E2 vs E3).
- **Dynamic Noise Gate:** Automatically adjust the detection threshold based on the ambient noise floor.
