# Pro-Guitar Tuner Roadmap

## Essential Tuner Functionality
**Goal:** Add standard features expected in a guitar tuner application.

- [x] **Manual String Selection:** Add clickable string buttons (E, A, D, G, B, e) to "lock" the tuner to a specific string. This prevents the tuner from jumping to the wrong octave or note when a string is very loose (e.g., during restringing).
- [ ] **Reference Pitch:** Add ability to adjust the reference pitch (A4) away from 440Hz (e.g., 432Hz, 442Hz), commonly used in orchestral or period settings.
- [ ] **Alternate Tunings:** Add support for common alternate tunings (Drop D, Open G, DADGAD) selectable via a menu.
